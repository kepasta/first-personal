My first personal Unity project
WiP for now.
A simple survival game to test how far my programming skills go. If I can do what I envision right, the inspiration will probably be obvious. Anyway, the game is not for sale, at least not in the current state, unless I figure out a way to give it some new cool direction both gameplay and story-wise.
